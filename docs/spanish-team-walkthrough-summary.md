# Medellin Rewards Walkthrough Summary for Spanish Translation

Purpose: this is the translation-ready walkthrough for all user types. It covers the current public, customer, business staff, business owner, and admin workflows, including the new QR-first customer flow.

Important product framing:

- The customer experience starts with the customer's own Member QR.
- Business staff scan the Member QR to record in-person purchases and assign points.
- Medellin Rewards tracks the commission owed from recorded QR sales.
- Catalog, rewards, gift card, and commerce features still exist, but the main demo should lead with QR.
