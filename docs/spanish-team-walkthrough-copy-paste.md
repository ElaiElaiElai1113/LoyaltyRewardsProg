# Medellin Rewards Walkthrough - Simple Version for Translation Team

Hi team, please translate this walkthrough into Spanish.

Please keep the instructions simple and clear. This guide is for people who may not know the app yet, so avoid complicated wording. The most important idea is:

The customer has their own QR code. The business scans that QR code when the customer buys something. The system gives the customer points and tracks the commission for Medellin Rewards.
