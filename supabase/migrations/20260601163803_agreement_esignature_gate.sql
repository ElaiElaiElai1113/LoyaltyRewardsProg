MEMBER AGREEMENT
Medellin Rewards Platform
Terms and Conditions of Membership

1. Membership Benefits
As a registered Medellin Rewards member, you may earn rewards by spending at listed partner or affiliate businesses, redeem earned rewards at listed partner or affiliate businesses, receive referral bonuses when available, access member offers and promotions, and retain earned rewards while your account remains active and in good standing.

Earn rates, referral bonuses, and membership fees may vary by campaign, business, or membership type. Current rates are shown inside the platform or communicated by Medellin Rewards before they apply.

2. Member Obligations and Conduct
By registering, you agree to treat partner and affiliate businesses, their staff, and other members with respect; keep your account information accurate; avoid unlawful, fraudulent, deceptive, or abusive activity; and follow current platform rules as updated with notice.

You may not resell, exchange, transfer, pool, or trade rewards with another person or entity. Rewards have no cash value and cannot be exchanged for money.

3. Account Rules
Only one account is permitted per person. Accounts are non-transferable. Duplicate accounts, fake referrals, self-referrals, false identity, or other abuse may result in suspension, cancellation, forfeiture of rewards, and permanent removal from the platform.

Medellin Rewards may request additional identity verification before enabling selected benefits, promotions, payouts, or high-risk activity. V1 membership access does not require document upload inside the app.

4. Third Party Disclaimer
Medellin Rewards is a third-party rewards platform. We are not responsible for the operations, products, services, quality, pricing, or conduct of partner or affiliate businesses. Members engage with partner businesses directly and at their own discretion. Disputes about a partner business transaction must be resolved directly with that business.

5. Medellin Rewards Rights
Medellin Rewards may suspend or cancel accounts that violate these terms; adjust earn rates, redemption rates, referral bonuses, or fees with reasonable notice; update these terms with notice of material changes; add or remove partner businesses; and request additional verification when needed.

6. Account Termination
Members may close their account by written request. On termination, unused rewards are forfeited and cannot be redeemed after account closure. Medellin Rewards may terminate an account immediately for breach of these terms, without refund where permitted by law.

7. Privacy and Confidentiality
Member personal data is handled according to the Medellin Rewards privacy policy and applicable law. Confidential platform information, rewards balances, and member account details may not be misused or disclosed except as required for platform operation or legal compliance.

8. Electronic Signature
By signing electronically, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to this Member Agreement; the information you provide is accurate; you are registering for your own personal use; and you understand that violations may result in account cancellation.

BUSINESS AFFILIATE AGREEMENT
Medellin Rewards Platform
Partner Business Onboarding Agreement

1. Purpose
This agreement governs the terms under which a participating business joins Medellin Rewards as a rewards partner. By joining, the business agrees to accept Medellin Rewards credits, vouchers, and gift cards from verified platform members in exchange for visibility, member traffic, reporting tools, and access to the platform member base.

2. Affiliate Benefits
The affiliate may receive an active listing on the platform, member traffic directed to the business, marketing exposure within the member network, a business account and dashboard, and transaction reporting for reconciliation. Account setup and activation are managed by Medellin Rewards.

3. Commercial Terms
Commission type, commission rate, payment schedule, and reporting method are agreed separately in the business account records or written commercial schedule. The affiliate must provide accurate and timely transaction records for commission calculation and reconciliation.

4. Affiliate Obligations
The affiliate agrees to accept Medellin Rewards credits, vouchers, and gift cards from verified registered platform members at full face value; apply no expiry date unless separately agreed in writing; apply no minimum spend, blackout dates, or exclusions unless agreed in writing; provide the same standard of service and product quality as for regular paying customers; treat members professionally and respectfully; and notify Medellin Rewards with at least 30 days' notice of closure, sale, change of ownership, or rebrand.

5. Competing Programs
The affiliate will not actively promote competing rewards programs to Medellin Rewards members on the affiliate premises or through platform-specific member interactions, unless Medellin Rewards agrees in writing.

6. Third Party Disclaimer
Medellin Rewards acts solely as a third-party rewards platform intermediary. Medellin Rewards is not responsible for the affiliate's business operations, products, services, quality, pricing, or disputes between the affiliate and customers, including Medellin Rewards members.

7. Account Activation and E-Signature
Before account access and platform activity are enabled, the affiliate must complete this agreement by e-signature through the platform. E-signatures are binding and are stored securely in the Medellin Rewards system with the agreement version and timestamp.

8. Exit and Termination
Either party may terminate this agreement with 30 days' written notice. Rewards already earned by members through the affiliate remain valid and must continue to be honored through and after the termination period. The affiliate may not claw back, cancel, or invalidate credits already earned by members before termination. Outstanding commission amounts must be settled according to the agreed payment schedule.

9. General Terms
This agreement supersedes prior discussions about affiliate platform participation. Both parties agree to keep confidential commercial terms confidential. Medellin Rewards is not liable for the affiliate's products, services, operations, or customer disputes except where required by law.

10. Electronic Signature
By signing electronically, the signer confirms that they are authorized to bind the affiliate business and that the affiliate has read, understood, and agreed to this Business Affiliate Agreement.

Direct Service-for-Credit Exchange

1. Purpose

4. Medellin Rewards Obligations
Medellin Rewards agrees to deliver agreed services according to the written scope and timeline, distribute issued credits only through the platform membership program, avoid resale or transfer outside the membership program, and maintain confidentiality of business information and agreement terms.

5. Third Party Disclaimer
Medellin Rewards acts solely as a third-party rewards platform. Medellin Rewards is not responsible for the business operations, products, services, quality, or conduct of the business or other partner businesses.

6. Dispute Resolution and Exit
The business must raise written disputes within 14 days of delivery of the relevant service. Medellin Rewards will make reasonable efforts to remedy the issue within 14 days after receiving written notice. Either party may exit with 30 days' written notice. Credits already issued to and earned by members remain valid and must continue to be honored.
